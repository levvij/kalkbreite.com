# Track Power Cables

## Power Bus
Connects power supplies to load balance them.
Prevents power from flowing through thin wires inside vehicles causing them to burn.

5mm2 black/red-split cable

## Section Bus
Connects power from power supplies to section distribution boards and between distribution boards.

2.5mm2 white cable with black stripe on GND side

All cables must be labled on both ends using their power section identifier ("ENS").
Use [white ~11.7mm printable shrink heat tubing](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005007592670468.html).

Use [5.08mm pluggable terminal blocks](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003777140682.html)

### Source Connection End
The source terminal connecting the first distribution board with the power module is **green**.

### Reversable Connection End
Use **red** plugs in sections where power is regularry reversed (example ERB)

### Normal Connection End
Normal connection ends use **white** plugs

## Track
Connects power from distribution boards to tracks.

1.5mm2 white cable with black stripe on GND side.
**Wiring Rule: BLACK TO THE BACK**.

Use [green 3.81 pluggable terminal blocks](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000781094941.html).

If a track was installed improperly, and a replacement is not feasable, use a red plug instead.
If a cable loops around (ENL) and one side is not black to the back, use a red plug instead.
